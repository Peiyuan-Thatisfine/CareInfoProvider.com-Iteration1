                Elder abuse is described as "a single or repeated act, or a failure to act appropriately, that causes harm or distress to an older person in any relationship where there is an expectation of trust." Abuse of the elderly can take many forms, including financial, physical, psychological, and sexual. It may also be caused by deliberate or accidental negligence.

                WHO reports that 15.7 percent of people aged 60 and up are abused, based on available data. Since several incidents of elder abuse go unreported, these incidence rates are likely to be underestimated. The
                number of people affected is expected to rise globally, as many countries' populations are increasingly aging.<br /><br />
                Individuals and communities suffer significant physical and psychological effects as a result of elder violence, including increased risk of nursing home placement, use of emergency care, hospitalization, and death.<br /><br />
                Evidence of prevalence in Australia is scarce, but if international trends are to be believed, between 2% and 14% of older Australians will be subjected to elder violence in any given year, with the prevalence of neglect probably much higher.<br /><br />
                The issue of elder abuse is becoming more of a concern as Australia's population ages: in 2050, just over a quarter of the population will be over 65, and those aged 85 and over will make up around 5% of the population.<br /><br />
                In order to identify or prevent elder abuse we are trying to aware people by putting up the information all together.<br />
